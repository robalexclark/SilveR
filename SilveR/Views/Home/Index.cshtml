Written for animal researchers, and the first to feature InVivoStat, it provides a comprehensive guide to designing and analysing animal experiments.

                            It has long been recognised that the proper implementation of sound statistical techniques helps reduce the number of animals needed. By using real-life examples to make them more accessible, this book explains the statistical tools that should be employed by researchers. A wide range of design types are considered, including block, factorial, nested, cross-over, dose-escalation and repeated measures and techniques are introduced to analyse the experimental data generated. Each analysis technique is described in non-mathematical terms, helping readers without a statistical background understand key techniques such as t-tests, ANOVA, repeated measures, analysis of covariance, multiple comparison tests, non-parametric and survival analysis. Taken together, this text and InVivoStat will help you make the most of your experiments.
