\section{Changes in Version 1.3-3 (2025-01-09)}{
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{Miwa(steps = 4097)} are allowed in R, the
            C code assumed \code{steps <= 4096}, now 
            \code{steps == 4097} is possible. Triggered by
            BDR's gcc-UBSAN check on package 
            OptimalGoldstandardDesign.
    }
  }
}


\section{Changes in Version 1.3-2 (2024-11-04)}{
  \subsection{Features}{
    \itemize{
      \item Explain and illustrate that omitting data dimensions produces marginal
            log-likelihoods in Chapter 7.
      \item Add low-level functionality for reduced rank covariances in new
            Chapter 8.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{invcholD} and \code{Dchol} avoided very small diagonals;
            now they also avoid very large diagonals (such that inverting the result
            doesn't give too small diagonals).
      \item Fix partial argument matches, reported by KH.
    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 1.3-1 (2024-09-02)}{
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Challenging numeric test of score function at ML estimate
            failed on Mac M1.
    }
  }
}


\section{Changes in Version 1.2-6 (2024-08-17)}{
  \subsection{Features}{
    \itemize{
      \item Add \code{logdet()} function for computing log-determinants from
            lower triangular matrices.
      \item Speed up \code{solve(<ltMatrices>, ...)}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Avoid unnecessary copying of large data objects.
      \item -1/2 -> -1 for det(C) in lmvnorm_src vignette; spotted by Kurt Hornik
      \item Use \code{M\_PI}.
    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 1.2-5 (2024-05-18)}{
  \subsection{Features}{
    \itemize{
      \item Update the \code{Using mvtnorm} package vignette and references therein.
      \item Speed up \code{Mult(<ltMatrices>, transpose = TRUE)}.
      \item Speed up \code{ldmvnorm()}.
      \item Add constructor \code{syMatrices()} for multiple symmetric
            matrices and \code{as.syMatrices()} for coercion from \code{ltMatrices}.}
  }
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fix segmentation fault or unnecessary error or warning + approximation for
      \code{algorithm = Miwa()} or \code{TVPACK()}, in case dimension
      reduction to one-dimensional is possible, e.g., for \preformatted{
  pmvnorm(lower = rep(-Inf,3), upper = c(-1, Inf, Inf),
          sigma = diag(3), algorithm = Miwa())
     # or
  pmvnorm(lower = c(-Inf,-Inf),
          upper = c(- 1,  Inf), sigma=diag(2), algorithm = TVPACK())
        }
    }

  \subsection{Features}{
    \itemize{
      \item Allow to change \code{rnorm} in \code{rmvnorm}, feature request
            by Ralf Stubner.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bugfixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fix variable declarations in \code{tvpack.f} as reported by Intel
            compilers icx/ipcx/ifx from oneAPI 2023.2.0 and oneMKL 2023.2.0, thanks to BDR
