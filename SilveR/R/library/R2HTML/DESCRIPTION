Description: Includes HTML function and methods to write in an HTML
        file. Thus, making HTML reports is easy. Includes a function
        that allows redirection on the fly, which appears to be very
        useful for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a copy of
        the produced output to keep all that he did during the course.
        Package comes with a vignette describing how to write HTML
        reports for statistical analysis. Finally, a driver for 'Sweave'
        allows to parse HTML flat files containing R code and to
        automatically write the corresponding outputs (tables and
        graphs).
