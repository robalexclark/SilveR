          \code{C_MPinv_sym}.
    \item Function \code{libcoin_StandardisePermutedLinearStatistic} was renamed
          to \code{libcoin_R_StandardisePermutedLinearStatistic}.

}

\section{Changes in Version 1.0-4 (2019-02-28)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Bugfix in regression tests.

  \itemize{
    \item Parts of the covariance matrix were not set to zero initially.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 1.0-2 (2018-12-13)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Maximally selected statistics failed for large sample sizes because of
          unnecessary memory allocation.  Report and fix by Joanidis
          Kristoforos.
    \item Some additional checks for integer overflow.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 1.0-1 (2017-12-13)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Make valgrind happy.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 1.0-0 (2017-12-12)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Make the package truly literate; there is one single \proglang{NUWEB}
          file called \file{libcoin.w} which generates the complete package.
    \item The package can now deal with long vectors.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.9-3 (2017-07-02)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Remove copy of \code{rcont2} from the \pkg{stats} package as it is
          exported now.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.9-1 (2017-02-06)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Calling \pkg{libcoin}'s \proglang{C} routines (using \code{.Call()})
          now requires the entry points to be specified as \R objects, i.e., the
          use of character strings is no longer allowed.
    \item Stop when all observations are missing.
    \item 2d case with missings in at least one variable used incorrect sample
          sizes and thus produced wrong results.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.9-0 (2016-12-09)}{
  \itemize{
    \item \pkg{libcoin} published on CRAN.
  }
