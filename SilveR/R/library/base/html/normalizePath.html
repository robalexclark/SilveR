<h2>Express File Paths in Canonical Form</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert file paths to canonical form for the platform, to display them
in a user-understandable form and so that relative and absolute paths can
be compared.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
normalizePath(path, winslash = "\\", mustWork = NA)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of file paths.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>winslash</code></td>
<td>
<p>the separator to be used on Windows &ndash; ignored
elsewhere.  Must be one of <code>c("/", "\\")</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mustWork</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: if <code>TRUE</code> then an error is given if the result
cannot be determined; if <code>NA</code> then a warning.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Tilde-expansion (see <code><a href="../../base/help/path.expand.html">path.expand</a></code>) is first done on
<code>paths</code>.
</p>
<p>Where the Unix-alike platform supports it attempts to turn paths into
absolute paths in their canonical form (no <span class="samp">./</span>, <span class="samp">../</span> nor
symbolic links).  It relies on the POSIX system function
<code>realpath</code>: if the platform does not have that (we know of no
current example) then the result will be an absolute path but might
not be canonical.  Even where <code>realpath</code> is used the canonical
path need not be unique, for example <em>via</em> hard links or
multiple mounts.
</p>
<p>On Windows it converts relative paths to absolute paths, resolves symbolic
links, converts short names for path elements to long names and ensures the
separator is that specified by <code>winslash</code>.  It will match each path
element case-insensitively or case-sensitively as during the usual name
lookup and return the canonical case. It relies on Windows API function
<code>GetFinalPathNameByHandle</code> and in case of an error (such as
insufficient permissions) it currently falls back to the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.6 (and
older) implementation, which relies on <code>GetFullPathName</code> and
<code>GetLongPathName</code> with limitations described in the Notes section.
An attempt is made not to introduce UNC paths in presence of mapped drives
or symbolic links: if <code>GetFinalPathNameByHandle</code> returns a UNC path,
but <code>GetLongPathName</code> returns a path starting with a drive letter, R
falls back to the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.6 (and older) implementation.
UTF-8-encoded paths not valid in the current locale can be used.
</p>
<p><code>mustWork = FALSE</code> is useful for expressing paths for use in
messages.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector.
</p>
<p>If an input is not a real path the result is system-dependent (unless
<code>mustWork = TRUE</code>, when this should be an error).  It will be
either the corresponding input element or a transformation of it into
an absolute path.
</p>
<p>Converting to an absolute file path can fail for a large number of
reasons.  The most common are
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> One of more components of the file path does not exist.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A component before the last is not a directory, or there is
insufficient permission to read the directory.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For a relative path, the current directory cannot be
determined.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A symbolic link points to a non-existent place or links form a
loop.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The canonicalized path would be exceed the maximum supported
length of a file path.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The canonical form of paths may not be what you expect.  For example,
on macOS absolute paths such as &lsquo;<span class="file">/tmp</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">/var</span>&rsquo; are
symbolic links. On Linux, a path produced by bash process substitution is
a symbolic link (such as &lsquo;<span class="file">/proc/fd/63</span>&rsquo;) to a pipe and there is no
canonical form of such path. In <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> 3.6 and older on Windows, symlinks will
not be resolved and the long names for path elements will be returned with
the case in which they are in <code>path</code>, which may not be canonical in
case-insensitive folders.
