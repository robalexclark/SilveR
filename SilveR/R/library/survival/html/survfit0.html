<h2>
Convert the format of a survfit object.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add the point for a starting time (time 0) to a survfit object's
elements.  This is useful for plotting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
survfit0(x, start.time=0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a survfit object</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired starting time; see details below.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Survival curves are traditionally plotted forward from time 0, but
since the true starting time is not known as a part of the data,
the <code>survfit</code> routine does not include a time 0 value in
the resulting object.
Someone might look at cumulative mortgage defaults versus calendar
year, for instance, with the &lsquo;time&rsquo; value a Date object.
The plotted curve probably should not start at 0 = 1970/01/01.
Due to this uncertainty, it was decided not to include a &quot;time 0&quot; as
part of a survfit object.  If the original <code>survfit</code> call
included a <code>start.time</code> argument, that value is of course
retained.
</p>
<p>Whether that (1989) decision was wise or
foolish, it is now far too late to change it. (We tried it once as a
trial, resulting in over 20 errors in the survival test suite.  We
extrapolate that it might break 1/2 - 2/3 of the other CRAN packages
that depend on survival, if made a default.)
If the original <code>survfit</code> call
included a <code>start.time</code> argument, that value is of course
retained.
</p>
<p>One problem with this choice is that some functions must choose a
starting point, plots for example.
This utility function is used by <code>plot.survfit</code> and
<code>summary.survfit</code> to do so, adding a new time point at the front of each
curve in a consistent way: the optional argument to the <code>survfit0</code>
function as the first choice (if supplied),
then the user's <code>start.time</code> if present,
otherwise <code>min(0, x$time)</code>.  The resulting object is <em>not</em>
guarranteed to work with functions that further manipulate a
<code>survfit</code> object such as subscripting, aggregation, pseudovalues,
etc. (remember the 20 errors).  Rather it is intended as a penultimate
step, most often when creating a plot.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a reformulated version of the object with an initial data point
at <code>start.time</code> added. 
The <code>time</code>, <code>surv</code>, <code>pstate</code>, <code>cumhaz</code>,
<code>std.err</code>, <code>std.cumhaz</code> and other components will all be aligned,
so as to make plots and summaries easier to produce.
