<h2>
Natural splines with knot heights as the basis.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create the design matrix for a natural spline, such that the coefficient
of the resulting fit are the values of the function at the knots.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
nsk(x, df = NULL, knots = NULL, intercept = FALSE, b = 0.05, 
    Boundary.knots = quantile(x, c(b, 1 - b), na.rm = TRUE))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the predictor variable.  Missing values are allowed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df</code></td>
<td>

<p>degrees of freedom. One can supply df rather than knots; ns() then
chooses df - 1 - intercept knots at suitably chosen quantiles of x
(which will ignore missing values).
The default, df = NULL, sets the number of inner knots as length(knots).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>knots</code></td>
<td>

<p>breakpoints that define the spline. The default is no knots;
together with the natural boundary conditions this results in a
basis for linear regression on x.
Typical values are the mean or median for one knot, quantiles for
more 
knots. See also Boundary.knots.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intercept</code></td>
<td>

<p>if TRUE, an intercept is included in the basis; default is FALSE
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>default placement of the boundary knots.  A value of
<code>bs=0</code> will replicate the default behavior of <code>ns</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Boundary.knots</code></td>
<td>

<p>boundary points at which to impose the natural boundary conditions and
anchor the B-spline basis.  Beyond these points the function is
assumed to be linear.
If both knots and Boundary.knots are supplied, the basis parameters do
not depend on x. Data can extend beyond Boundary.knots
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>nsk</code> function behaves identically to the <code>ns</code> function,
with two exceptions.  The primary one is that the returned basis is
such that coefficients correspond to the value of the fitted function
at the knot points.  If <code>intercept = FALSE</code>, there will be k-1
coefficients corresponding to the k knots, and they will be the difference
in predicted value between knots 2-k and knot 1.
The primary advantage to the basis is that the coefficients are
directly interpretable.  A second is that tests for the linear and
non-linear components are simple contrasts.
</p>
<p>The second differnce with <code>ns</code> is one of opinion with respect to
the default position for the boundary knots.  The default here is
closer to that found in the <code>rms::rcs</code> function.
</p>
<p>This function is a trial if a new idea, it's future inclusion in the
package is not yet guarranteed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of dimension length(x) * df where either df was supplied or,
if knots were supplied, df = length(knots) + 1 + intercept.
Attributes are returned that correspond to the arguments to kns,
and explicitly give the knots, Boundary.knots etc for use by predict.kns().
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A thin flexible metal or wooden strip is called a spline, and is the
traditional method for laying out a smooth curve, e.g., for a ship's
hull or an airplane wing.  Pins are put into a board and the strip is
passed through them, each pin is a 'knot'.
</p>
<p>A mathematical spline is a piecewise function between each knot.  A
linear spline will be a set of connected line segments, a quadratic
spline is a set of connected local quadratic functions, constrained to
have a continuous first derivative, a cubic spline is cubic between
each knot, constrained to have continuous first and second
derivatives, and etc.  Mathematical splines are not an exact
representation of natural splines: being a physical object the wood or
metal strip will have continuous derivatives of all orders.  Cubic
splines are commonly used because they are sufficiently smooth to
look natural to the human eye.
</p>
<p>If the mathematical spline is further constrained to be linear beyond
the end knots, this is often called a 'natural spline', due to the
fact that a wooden or metal spline will also be linear beyond the last
knots.  Another name for the same object is a 'restricted cubic
spline', since it is achieved in code by adding further constraints.
Given a vector of data points and a set of knots, it is possible to
create a basis matrix X with one column per knot, such that ordinary
regression of X on y will fit the cubic spline function, hence these
are also called 'regression splines'. (One of these three labels is no
better or worse than another, in our opinion).
</p>
<p>Given a basis matrix X with k columns, the
matrix Z= XT for any k by k nonsingular matrix T is is also a basis
matrix, and will result in identical predicted values, but a new set
of coefficients gamma = (T-inverse) beta in place of beta.  One can
choose the basis functions so that X is easy to construct, to
make the regression numerically stable, to make tests easier, or based
on other considerations.
It seems as though every spline library returns a different basis
set, which unfortunately makes fits difficult to compare between packages.
This is yet one more basis set, chosen to make the coefficients
more interpretable.
