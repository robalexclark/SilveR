<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tuning function should be used to tune the parameters in the
<code>splsda</code> function (number of components and number of variables in
<code>keepX</code> to select).
</p>
<p>For a sPLS-DA, M-fold or LOO cross-validation is performed with stratified
subsampling where all classes are represented in each fold.
</p>
<p>If <code>validation = "loo"</code>, leave-one-out cross-validation is performed.
By default <code>folds</code> is set to the number of unique individuals.
</p>
<p>The function outputs the optimal number of components that achieve the best
performance based on the overall error rate or BER. The assessment is
data-driven and similar to the process detailed in (Rohart et al., 2016),
where one-sided t-tests assess whether there is a gain in performance when
adding a component to the model. Our experience has shown that in most case,
the optimal number of components is the number of categories in <code>Y</code> -
1, but it is worth tuning a few extra components to check (see our website
and case studies for more details).
</p>
<p>For sPLS-DA multilevel one-factor analysis, M-fold or LOO cross-validation
is performed where all repeated measurements of one sample are in the same
fold. Note that logratio transform and the multilevel analysis are performed
internally and independently on the training and test set.
</p>
<p>For a sPLS-DA multilevel two-factor analysis, the correlation between
components from the within-subject variation of X and the <code>cond</code> matrix
is computed on the whole data set. The reason why we cannot obtain a
cross-validation error rate as for the spls-DA one-factor analysis is
because of the difficulty to decompose and predict the within matrices
within each fold.
</p>
<p>For a sPLS two-factor analysis a sPLS canonical mode is run, and the
correlation between components from the within-subject variation of X and Y
is computed on the whole data set.
</p>
<p>If <code>validation = "Mfold"</code>, M-fold cross-validation is performed. How
many folds to generate is selected by specifying the number of folds in
<code>folds</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>auc = TRUE</code> and there are more than 2 categories in <code>Y</code>, the
Area Under the Curve is averaged using one-vs-all comparison. Note however
that the AUC criteria may not be particularly insightful as the prediction
threshold we use in sPLS-DA differs from an AUC threshold (sPLS-DA relies on
prediction distances for predictions, see <code>?predict.splsda</code> for more
details) and the supplemental material of the mixOmics article (Rohart et
al. 2017). If you want the AUC criterion to be insightful, you should use
<code>measure==AUC</code> as this will output the number of variable that
maximises the AUC; in this case there is no prediction threshold from
sPLS-DA (<code>dist</code> is not used). If <code>measure==AUC</code>, we do not output
SD as this measure can be a mean (over <code>nrepeat</code>) of means (over the
categories).
</p>
<p>BER is appropriate in case of an unbalanced number of samples per class as
it calculates the average proportion of wrongly classified samples in each
class, weighted by the number of samples in each class. BER is less biased
towards majority classes during the performance assessment.
</p>
<p>More details about the prediction distances in <code>?predict</code> and the
supplemental material of the mixOmics article (Rohart et al. 2017).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## First example: analysis with sPLS-DA

data(breast.tumors)
X = breast.tumors$gene.exp
Y = as.factor(breast.tumors$sample$treatment)
tune = tune.splsda(X, Y, ncomp = 1, nrepeat = 10, logratio = "none",
test.keepX = c(5, 10, 15), folds = 10, dist = "max.dist",
progressBar = TRUE)

## Not run: 
# 5 components, optimising 'keepX' and 'ncomp'
tune = tune.splsda(X, Y, ncomp = 5, test.keepX = c(5, 10, 15),
folds = 10, dist = "max.dist", nrepeat = 5, progressBar = FALSE)

tune$choice.ncomp
tune$choice.keepX
plot(tune)

## only tune component 3 and 4
# keeping 5 and 10 variables on the first two components respectively

tune = tune.splsda(X = X,Y = Y, ncomp = 4,
already.tested.X = c(5,10),
test.keepX = seq(1,10,2), progressBar = TRUE)

## Second example: multilevel one-factor analysis with sPLS-DA

data(vac18)
X = vac18$genes
Y = vac18$stimulation
# sample indicates the repeated measurements
design = data.frame(sample = vac18$sample)

tune = tune.splsda(X, Y = Y, ncomp = 3, nrepeat = 10, logratio = "none",
test.keepX = c(5,50,100),folds = 10, dist = "max.dist", multilevel = design)
