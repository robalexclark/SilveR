<h2>Simulated data based on the vac18 study for multilevel analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data based on the vac18 study to illustrate the use of the
multilevel analysis for one and two-factor analysis with sPLS-DA. This data
set contains the expression simulated of 500 genes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(vac18.simulated)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing the following components: </p>

<dl>
<dt>list(&quot;genes&quot;)</dt><dd><p>data frame with 48 rows and 500 columns. The simulated
expression of 500 genes for 48 subjects.</p>
</dd> <dt>list(&quot;sample&quot;)</dt><dd><p>a vector
indicating the repeated measurements on each unique subject. See Details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>list(&quot;stimulation&quot;)</dt><dd><p>a factor indicating the stimulation condition on
each sample.</p>
</dd> <dt>list(&quot;time&quot;)</dt><dd><p>a factor indicating the time condition on
each sample.</p>
</dd> </dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this cross-over design, repeated measurements are performed 12
experiments units (or unique subjects) for each of the 4 stimulations.
</p>
<p>The simulation study was based on a mixed effects model (see reference for
details). Ten clusters of 100 genes were generated. Amongt those, 4 clusters
of genes discriminate the 4 stimulations (denoted LIPO5, GAG+, GAG- and NS)
as follows: \ -2 gene clusters discriminate (LIPO5, GAG+) versus (GAG-, NS)
\ -2 gene clusters discriminate LIPO5 versus GAG+, while GAG+ and NS have
the same effect \ -2 gene clusters discriminate GAG- versus NS, while LIPO5
and GAG+ have the same effect \ -the 4 remaining clusters represent noisy
signal (no stimulation effect) \
</p>
<p>Only a subset of those genes are presented here (to save memory space).
</p>
