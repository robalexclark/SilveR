<h2>Simulated data based on the vac18 study for multilevel analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data based on the vac18 study to illustrate the use of the multilevel analysis for one and two-factor
analysis with sPLS-DA. This data set contains the expression simulated of 500 genes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(vac18.simulated)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing the following components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>genes</code></dt><dd><p>data frame with 48 rows and 500 columns. The simulated expression of 500 genes for
48 subjects.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sample</code></dt><dd><p>a vector indicating the repeated measurements on each unique subject. See Details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stimulation</code></dt><dd><p>a factor indicating the stimulation condition on each sample.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt><dd><p>a factor indicating the time condition on each sample.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this cross-over design, repeated measurements are performed 12 experiments units (or unique subjects) for each of the 4 stimulations.
</p>
<p>The simulation study was based on a mixed effects model (see reference for details). Ten clusters of 100 genes were generated. Amongt those, 4 clusters of genes discriminate the 4 stimulations (denoted LIPO5, GAG+, GAG- and NS) as follows: \
-2 gene clusters discriminate (LIPO5, GAG+) versus (GAG-, NS) \
-2 gene clusters discriminate LIPO5 versus GAG+, while GAG+ and  NS have the same effect \
-2 gene clusters discriminate GAG- versus NS, while LIPO5 and GAG+ have the same effect \
-the 4 remaining clusters represent noisy signal (no stimulation effect) \
</p>
<p>Only a subset of those genes are presented here (to save memory space).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>none</p>
