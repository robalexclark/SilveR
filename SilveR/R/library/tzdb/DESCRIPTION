Description: Provides an up-to-date copy of the Internet Assigned Numbers
    Authority (IANA) Time Zone Database. It is updated periodically to
    reflect changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC
    offsets, and daylight saving time rules. Additionally, this package
    provides a C++ interface for working with the 'date' library. 'date'
    provides comprehensive support for working with dates and date-times,
    which this package exposes to make it easier for other R packages to
    utilize. Headers are provided for calendar specific calculations,
    along with a limited interface for time zone manipulations.
