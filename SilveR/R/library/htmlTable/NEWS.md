NEWS for the htmlTable package

Changes for 2.4.0
-----------------
* The `txtRound.data.frame` converted all data to a matrix before rounding all elements. Changed
  to only convert numeric variables and also added tidy-select syntax. The function now returns
  the entire input `data.frame` with rounded elements as requested.
* The `txtMergeLines` now returns an `knitr::asis_output` if html mode is activated. Fixed also
  multiline strings conversion into latex/html format.
* Added vignette for the text formatting functions.

Changes for 2.3.0
-----------------
* Added `rnames_unique` parameter to `tidyHtmlTable` so that rows can have non-unique names

Changes for 2.2.1
-----------------
* The `txtInt` handles `NA` more gracefully.

Changes fro 2.2.0
-----------------
* Added `htmlTable_args` attribute for making modifications to the final table easier

Changes fro 2.1.0
-----------------
* Added options for how the empty spacer cell appears (see `addHtmlTableStyle()` spacer.* options)
* Fixed ignored `align.header`
* Fix for wrapped styles (issue #80)

Changes for 2.0.1
-----------------
* Fix for txtRound not handling negative numbers (issue #76)
* Fix bug for `hidden.rgroup` & `hidden_tspanner` in `tidyHtmlTable`
* Documentation improvements & switched to markdown docs

Changes for 2.0.0
------------------
* Added theming and styling with `addHtmlTableStyle` and `setHtmlTableTheme` to reduce the cognitive burden of finding the right
  option within the docs. Note: this may impact your current tables and hence the major version (2.0.0).
* Changed so that `css.cell` is properly applied to rownames, cell fillers and the actual cells of interest (may impact the final layout!)
* Breaking change `tidyHtmlTable`: Moved to a fully tidyverse compatible system with tidyHtmlTable. This is a breaking change to the API as we switch from
  columns as strings to `tidyselect` syntax and as `gather`/`spread` have been replaced by `pivot_longer`/`pivot_wider`
  the default values have been updated in accordance with their defaults, e.g. `rnames = "name"` and `value = "value"`.
* Breaking change `tidyHtmlTable`: Sorting of rows is skipped as we may have situations with repeating inputs and this can easily
  be performed pre-function by calling `dplyr::arrange`. This has furthermore the desirable feature that any custom sorting
  is retained.
* Added *mso-number-format* to help (Issue #63) - thanks Rasmus Hertzum
* txtRound can now add txtInt when formatting the integer section for easier readability
* Added htmlTable css options - they should all start with `htmlTable.`
* `pos.caption` now uses match.arg as expected
* Fixed proper S3 function definition for `htmlTable` with all the arguments
* Added `htmlTable.css.border` style option for allowing to choose border style. Also fixed bug with cgroup empty cells and vertical border.
* Added `htmlTable.pretty_indentation` option for skipping the stripping of all the tabs that was required due to old Pandoc bug.
* Added `attr(x, "html") <- TRUE` by default and UTF-8 encoding on all outputted strings to mimic the `htmltools::HTML` function behavior.
* For simple tibble output the `tidyHtmlTable` can now be used to choose a column for the rnames argument
* The print statement now respects the `chunk_output_type` in Rmd files in RStudio
* `tidyHtmlTable` now accepts table function that allows switching to other table functions
* Added `css.header` style as using `css.cell` wasn't entirely intuitive (fixes issue #73)

* Removed the `format.df` from Hmisc as it converted & to \& with unexpected results. This functionality
  has also been superseeded by the txtRound function.

Changes for 1.1
-----------------

  of adding more data to that particular row
* Added a fix for the pandoc tab bug

* Argument name changes for `htmlTable` for better consistency and logic:
    `rowname` -> `rnames`
    `headings` -> `header`
    `halign` -> `align.header`
    `cgroup.just` -> `align.cgroup`
    `rgroupCSSstyle` -> `css.rgroup`
    `rgroupCSSseparator` -> `css.rgroup.sep`
    `tspannerCSSstyle` -> `css.tspanner`
    `tspannerCSSseparator` -> `css.tspanner.sep`
    `tableCSSclass` -> `css.table.class`
    `rowlabel.pos` -> `pos.rowlabel`
    `caption.loc` -> `pos.caption`
    `altcol` -> `col.rgroup`
* `htmlTable` can now handle `rnames = FALSE` in order to surpress rownames
* `htmlTable` now defaults to the layout of `ctable` as this is the more commonly found layout among medical papers
* `htmlTable` `rgroup` has the additional `padding.rgroup` for those that want to change the no-breaking space padding
* `htmlTable` `tfoot` is automatically run through `txtMergeLines` in order to retain wrapped text
* Renamed `splitLines4Table` to `txtMergeLines`, `outputInt` to `txtInt`, `pvalueFormatter` to `txtPval` and these follow now the argument style of `htmlTable`
* Added `txtRound` for rounding matrices. The problem with `round()` is that 1.01 rounds to 1
  instead of "1.0" that is wanted for output.
* Multiple bug-fixes
