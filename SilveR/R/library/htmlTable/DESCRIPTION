Description: Tables with state-of-the-art layout elements such as row spanners,
    column spanners, table spanners, zebra striping, and more. While allowing
    advanced layout, the underlying css-structure is simple in order to maximize
    compatibility with common word processors.  The package also contains a few 
    text formatting functions that help outputting text compatible with HTML/LaTeX.
