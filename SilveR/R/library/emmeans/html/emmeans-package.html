<h2>Estimated marginal means (aka Least-squares means)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides methods for obtaining estimated marginal means (EMMs, also 
known as least-squares means) for factor combinations in a variety of models.
Supported models include [generalized linear] models, models for counts,
multivariate, multinomial and ordinal responses, survival models, GEEs, and
Bayesian models. For the latter, posterior samples of EMMs are provided.
The package can compute contrasts or linear
combinations of these marginal means with various multiplicity adjustments.
One can also estimate and contrast slopes of trend lines.
Some graphical displays of these results are provided.
</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>


<dl>
<dt>Vignettes</dt><dd><p>A number of vignettes are provided to help the user get
acquainted with the <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> package and see some examples.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Concept</dt><dd><p>Estimated marginal means (see Searle <em>et al.</em> 1980 are
popular for summarizing linear models that include factors. For balanced
experimental designs, they are just the marginal means. For unbalanced data,
they in essence estimate the marginal means you <em>would</em> have observed
that the data arisen from a balanced experiment. Earlier developments
regarding these techniques were developed in a least-squares context and are
sometimes referred to as &ldquo;least-squares means&rdquo;. Since its early
development, the concept has expanded far beyond least-squares settings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Reference grids</dt><dd><p> The implementation in <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> relies on our own
concept of a <em>reference grid</em>, which is an array of factor and predictor
levels. Predictions are made on this grid, and estimated marginal means (or
EMMs) are defined as averages of these predictions over zero or more
dimensions of the grid. The function <code><a href="ref_grid.html">ref_grid</a></code> explicitly
creates a reference grid that can subsequently be used to obtain
least-squares means. The object returned by <code>ref_grid</code> is of class
<code>"emmGrid"</code>, the same class as is used for estimated marginal means (see
below).
</p>
<p>Our reference-grid framework expands slightly upon Searle <em>et al.</em>'s
definitions of EMMs, in that it is possible to include multiple levels of
covariates in the grid. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Models supported</dt><dd><p>As is mentioned in the package description, many
types of models are supported by the package. 
See <a href="../doc/models.html">vignette(&quot;models&quot;, &quot;emmeans&quot;)</a> for full details. 
Some models may require other packages be
installed in order to  access all of the available features.
For models not explicitly supported, it may still be possible to do basic
post hoc analyses of them via the <code><a href="qdrg.html">qdrg</a></code> function.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Estimated marginal means</dt><dd>
<p>The <code><a href="emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code> function computes EMMs given a fitted model (or a
previously constructed <code>emmGrid</code> object), using a specification indicating
what factors to include. The <code><a href="emtrends.html">emtrends</a></code> function creates the same
sort of results for estimating and comparing slopes of fitted lines. Both
return an <code>emmGrid</code> object.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Summaries and analysis</dt><dd>
<p>The <code><a href="summary.emmGrid.html">summary.emmGrid</a></code>  method may be used to display an <code>emmGrid</code>
object. Special-purpose summaries are available via <code><a href="summary.emmGrid.html">confint.emmGrid</a></code> and
<code><a href="summary.emmGrid.html">test.emmGrid</a></code>, the latter of which can also do a joint test of several
estimates. The user may specify by variables, multiplicity-adjustment
methods, confidence levels, etc., and if a transformation or link function is
involved, may reverse-transform the results to the response scale.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Contrasts and comparisons</dt><dd>
<p>The <code><a href="contrast.html">contrast</a></code> method for <code>emmGrid</code> objects is used to obtain
contrasts among the estimates; several standard contrast families are
available such as deviations from the mean, polynomial contrasts, and
comparisons with one or more controls. Another <code>emmGrid</code> object is returned,
which can be summarized or further analyzed. For convenience, a <code>pairs.emmGrid</code>
method is provided for the case of pairwise comparisons. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Graphs</dt><dd><p>The <code><a href="plot.html">plot.emmGrid</a></code> method will display
side-by-side confidence intervals for the estimates, and/or
&ldquo;comparison arrows&rdquo; whereby the *P* values of pairwise differences
can be observed by how much the arrows overlap. The <code><a href="emmip.html">emmip</a></code> function
displays estimates like an interaction plot, multi-paneled if there are by
variables. These graphics capabilities require the <span class="pkg">lattice</span> package be
installed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MCMC support</dt><dd><p>When a model is fitted using MCMC methods, the posterior
chains(s) of parameter estimates are retained and converted into posterior
samples of EMMs or contrasts thereof. These may then be summarized or plotted
like any other MCMC results, using tools in, say <span class="pkg">coda</span> or
<span class="pkg">bayesplot</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="pkg">multcomp</span> interface</dt><dd><p>The <code><a href="glht-support.html">as.glht</a></code> function and
<code>glht</code> method for <code>emmGrid</code>s provide an interface to the
<code>glht</code> function in the <span class="pkg">multcomp</span> package, thus
providing for more exacting simultaneous estimation or testing. The package
also provides an <code><a href="glht-support.html">emm</a></code> function that works as an alternative to
<code>mcp</code> in a call to <code>glht</code>.
