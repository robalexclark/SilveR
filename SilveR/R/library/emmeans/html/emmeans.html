<h2>Estimated marginal means (Least-squares means)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute estimated marginal means (EMMs) for specified factors
or factor combinations in a linear model; and optionally, comparisons or
contrasts among them. EMMs are also known as least-squares means.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
emmeans(object, specs, by = NULL, fac.reduce = function(coefs) apply(coefs,
  2, mean), contr, options = get_emm_option("emmeans"), weights, offset, ...,
  tran)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>emmGrid</code>; or a fitted model object
that is supported, such as the result of a call to <code>lm</code> or
<code>lmer</code>. Many fitted-model objects are supported; see
<a href="../doc/models.html"><code>vignette("models", "emmeans")</code></a> for details.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>specs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>character</code> vector specifying the names of the predictors
over which EMMs are desired. <code>specs</code> may also be a <code>formula</code>
or a <code>list</code> (optionally named) of valid <code>spec</code>s. Use of formulas
is described in the Overview section below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector specifying the names of predictors to condition on.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fac.reduce</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function that combines the rows of a matrix into a single
vector. This implements the &ldquo;marginal averaging&rdquo; aspect of EMMs. 
The default is the mean of the rows. Typically if it is overridden,
it would be some kind of weighted mean of the rows. If <code>fac.reduce</code> is
nonlinear, bizarre results are likely, and EMMs will not be
interpretable. NOTE: If the <code>weights</code> argument is non-missing,
<code>fac.reduce</code> is ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contr</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character value or <code>list</code> specifying contrasts to be
added. See <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/contrast.html">contrast</a></code>. NOTE: <code>contr</code> is ignored when
<code>specs</code> is a formula.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>options</code></td>
<td>
<p>If non-<code>NULL</code>, a named <code>list</code> of arguments to pass
to <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code>, just after the object is constructed.
(Options may also be included in <code>...</code>; see the &lsquo;options&rsquo;
section below.)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character value, numeric vector, or numeric matrix specifying
weights to use in averaging predictions. See &ldquo;Weights&rdquo; section below.
Also, if <code>object</code> is not already a reference grid, <code>weights</code>
(if it is character) is passed to <code>ref_grid</code> as <code>wt.nuis</code> in case 
nuisance factors are specified. We can override this by specifying 
<code>wt.nuis</code> explicitly.
This more-or-less makes the weighting of nuisance factors consistent with
that of primary factors.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector or scalar. If specified, this adds an offset to
the predictions, or overrides any offset in the model or its
reference grid. If a vector of length differing from the number of rows in 
the result, it is subsetted or cyclically recycled.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>When <code>object</code> is not already a <code>"emmGrid"</code>
object, these arguments are passed to <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/ref_grid.html">ref_grid</a></code>. Common
examples are <code>at</code>, <code>cov.reduce</code>, <code>data</code>, codetype, 
<code>regrid</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>nesting</code>, and <code>vcov.</code>.
Model-type-specific options (see
<a href="../doc/models.html"><code>vignette("models", "emmeans")</code></a>), commonly
<code>mode</code>, may be used here as well. In addition, if the model formula
contains references to variables that are not predictors, you must provide
a <code>params</code> argument with a list of their names.
</p>
<p>These arguments may also be used in lieu of <code>options</code>. See the 
&lsquo;Options&rsquo; section below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tran</code></td>
<td>
<p>Placeholder to prevent it from being included in <code>...</code>.
If non-missing, it is added to 'options'. See the &lsquo;Options&rsquo;
section.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Users should also consult the documentation for <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/ref_grid.html">ref_grid</a></code>, 
because many important options for EMMs are implemented there, via the 
<code>...</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When <code>specs</code> is a <code>character</code> vector or one-sided formula,
an object of class <code>"emmGrid"</code>. A number of methods
are provided for further analysis, including
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/summary.emmGrid.html">summary.emmGrid</a></code>, <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/confint.emmGrid.html">confint.emmGrid</a></code>,
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/test.emmGrid.html">test.emmGrid</a></code>, <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/contrast.emmGrid.html">contrast.emmGrid</a></code>,
and <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/pairs.emmGrid.html">pairs.emmGrid</a></code>.
When <code>specs</code> is a <code>list</code> or a <code>formula</code> having a left-hand
side, the return value is an <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emm_list.html">emm_list</a></code> object, which is simply a
<code>list</code> of <code>emmGrid</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Estimated marginal means or EMMs (sometimes called least-squares means) are
predictions from a linear model over a <em>reference grid</em>; or marginal
averages thereof. The <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/ref_grid.html">ref_grid</a></code> function identifies/creates the
reference grid upon which <code>emmeans</code> is based.
</p>
<p>For those who prefer the terms &ldquo;least-squares means&rdquo; or
&ldquo;predicted marginal means&rdquo;, functions <code>lsmeans</code> and
<code>pmmeans</code> are provided as wrappers. See <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/wrappers.html">wrappers</a></code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>specs</code> is a <code>formula</code>, it should be of the form <code>~ specs</code>,
<code>~ specs | by</code>, <code>contr ~ specs</code>, or <code>contr ~ specs | by</code>. The
formula is parsed and the variables therein are used as the arguments
<code>specs</code>, <code>by</code>, and <code>contr</code> as indicated. The left-hand side is
optional, but if specified it should be the name of a contrast family (e.g.,
<code>pairwise</code>). Operators like
<code>*</code> or <code>:</code> are needed in the formula to delineate names, but
otherwise are ignored.
</p>
<p>In the special case where the mean (or weighted mean) of all the predictions
is desired, specify <code>specs</code> as <code>~ 1</code> or <code>"1"</code>.
</p>
<p>A number of standard contrast families are provided. They can be identified 
as functions having names ending in <code>.emmc</code> &ndash; see the documentation
for <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmc-functions.html">emmc-functions</a></code> for details &ndash; including how to write your
own <code>.emmc</code> function for custom contrasts.
</p>


<h3>Weights</h3>

<p>If <code>weights</code> is a vector, its length must equal
the number of predictions to be averaged to obtain each EMM.
If a matrix, each row of the matrix is used in turn, wrapping back to the
first row as needed.  When in doubt about what is being averaged (or how
many), first call <code>emmeans</code> with <code>weights = "show.levels"</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>weights</code> is a string, it should partially match one of the following:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"equal"</code></dt><dd><p>Use an equally weighted average.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"proportional"</code></dt><dd><p>Weight in proportion to the frequencies (in the
original data) of the factor combinations that are averaged over.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"outer"</code></dt><dd><p>Weight in proportion to each individual factor's
marginal frequencies. Thus, the weights for a combination of factors are the
outer product of the one-factor margins</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"cells"</code></dt><dd><p>Weight according to the frequencies of the cells being
averaged.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"flat"</code></dt><dd><p>Give equal weight to all cells with data, and ignore
empty cells.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"show.levels"</code></dt><dd><p>This is a convenience feature for understanding
what is being averaged over. Instead of a table of EMMs, this causes the
function to return a table showing the levels that are averaged over, in the
order that they appear.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Outer weights are like the 'expected' counts in a chi-square test of
independence, and will yield the same results as those obtained by
proportional averaging with one factor at a time. All except <code>"cells"</code>
uses the same set of weights for each mean. In a model where the predicted
values are the cell means, cell weights will yield the raw averages of the
data for the factors involved. Using <code>"flat"</code> is similar to
<code>"cells"</code>, except nonempty cells are weighted equally and empty cells
are ignored.
</p>


<h3>Offsets</h3>

<p>Unlike in <code>ref_grid</code>, an offset need not be scalar. If not enough values
are supplied, they are cyclically recycled. For a vector of offsets, it is 
important to understand that the ordering of results goes with the first 
name in <code>specs</code> varying fastest. If there are any <code>by</code> factors,
those vary slower than all the primary ones, but the first <code>by</code> variable
varies the fastest within that hierarchy. See the examples.
</p>


<h3>Options and <code>...</code></h3>

<p>Arguments that could go in <code>options</code> may instead be included in <code>...</code>,
typically, arguments such as <code>type</code>, <code>infer</code>, etc. that in essence
are passed to <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/summary.emmGrid.html">summary.emmGrid</a></code>. Arguments in both places are 
overridden by the ones in <code>...</code>.
</p>
<p>There is a danger that <code>...</code> arguments could partially match those used
by both <code>ref_grid</code> and <code>update.emmGrid</code>, creating a conflict.
If these occur, usually they can be resolved by providing complete (or at least 
longer) argument names; or by isolating non-<code>ref_grid</code> arguments in
<code>options</code>; or by calling <code>ref_grid</code> separately and passing the
result as <code>object</code>. See a not-run example below.
</p>
<p>Also, when <code>specs</code> is a two-sided formula, or <code>contr</code> is specified,
there is potential confusion concerning which <code>...</code> arguments
apply to the means, and which to the contrasts. When such confusion is possible,
we suggest doing things separately 
(a call to <code>emmeans</code> with no contrasts, followed by a call to 
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/contrast.html">contrast</a></code>). We do treat
for <code>adjust</code> as a special case: it is applied to the <code>emmeans</code> results 
<em>only</em> if there are
no contrasts specified, otherwise it is passed to <code>contrast</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
warp.lm &lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool * tension, data = warpbreaks)
emmeans (warp.lm,  ~ wool | tension)
# or equivalently emmeans(warp.lm, "wool", by = "tension")

# 'adjust' argument ignored in emmeans, passed to contrast part...
emmeans (warp.lm, poly ~ tension | wool, adjust = "sidak")

## Not run: 
# 'adjust' argument NOT ignored ...
emmeans (warp.lm, ~ tension | wool, adjust = "sidak")

## End(Not run)

## Not run: 
  ### Offsets: Consider a silly example:
  emmeans(warp.lm, ~ tension | wool, offset = c(17, 23, 47)) @ grid
  # note that offsets are recycled so that each level of tension receives
  # the same offset for each wool.
  # But using the same offsets with ~ wool | tension will probably not
  # be what you want because the ordering of combinations is different.

## End(Not run)
