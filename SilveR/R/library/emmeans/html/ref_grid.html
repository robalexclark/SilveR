<h2>Create a reference grid from a fitted model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using a fitted model object, determine a reference grid for which estimated
marginal means are defined. The resulting <code>ref_grid</code> object encapsulates
all the information needed to calculate EMMs and make inferences on them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ref_grid(object, at, cov.reduce = mean,
  cov.keep = get_emm_option("cov.keep"), mult.names, mult.levs,
  options = get_emm_option("ref_grid"), data, df, type, regrid, nesting,
  offset, sigma, counterfactuals, wt.counter, avg.counter = TRUE,
  nuisance = character(0), non.nuisance, wt.nuis = "equal",
  rg.limit = get_emm_option("rg.limit"), ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object produced by a supported model-fitting function, such
as <code>lm</code>. Many models are supported. See
<a href="../doc/models.html"><code>vignette("models", "emmeans")</code></a>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>at</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional named list of levels for the corresponding variables</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cov.reduce</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function, logical value, or formula; or a named list of
these. Each covariate <em>not</em> specified in <code>cov.keep</code> or <code>at</code>
is reduced according to these specifications. See the section below on
&ldquo;Using <code>cov.reduce</code> and <code>cov.keep</code>&rdquo;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cov.keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector: names of covariates that are <em>not</em>
to be reduced; these are treated as factors and used in weighting calculations.
<code>cov.keep</code> may also include integer value(s), and if so, the maximum
of these is used to set a threshold such that any covariate having no more
than that many unique values is automatically included in <code>cov.keep</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mult.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character value: the name(s) to give to the
pseudo-factor(s) whose levels delineate the elements of a multivariate
response. If this is provided, it overrides the default name(s) used for
<code>class(object)</code> when it has a multivariate response (e.g., the default
is <code>"rep.meas"</code> for <code>"mlm"</code> objects).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mult.levs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list of levels for the dimensions of a multivariate
response. If there is more than one element, the combinations of levels are
used, in <code><a href="../../base/html/expand.grid.html">expand.grid</a></code> order. The (total) number of levels must
match the number of dimensions. If <code>mult.name</code> is specified, this
argument is ignored.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>options</code></td>
<td>
<p>If non-<code>NULL</code>, a named <code>list</code> of arguments to pass
to <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code>, just after the object is constructed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> to use to obtain information about the
predictors (e.g. factor levels). If missing, then
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/recover_data.html">recover_data</a></code> is used to attempt to reconstruct the data. See
the note with <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/recover_data.html">recover_data</a></code> for an important precaution.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric value. This is equivalent to specifying <code>options(df =
df)</code>. See <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character value. If provided, this is saved as the
<code>"predict.type"</code> setting. See <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code> and the
section below on prediction types and transformations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>regrid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character, logical, or list. If non-missing, the reference
grid is reconstructed via <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/regrid.html">regrid</a></code> with the argument
<code>transform = regrid</code>. See the section below on prediction types and
transformations. <em>Note:</em> This argument was named <code>transform</code> in
version 1.7.2 and earlier. For compatibility with old code, <code>transform</code>
is still accepted if found among <code>...</code>, 
as long as it doesn't match <code>tran</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nesting</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the model has nested fixed effects, this may be specified
here via a character vector or named <code>list</code> specifying the nesting
structure. Specifying <code>nesting</code> overrides any nesting structure that
is automatically detected. See the section below on Recovering or Overriding 
Model Information.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric scalar value (if a vector, only the first element is
used). This may be used to add an offset, or override offsets based on the
model. A common usage would be to specify <code>offset = 0</code> for a Poisson
regression model, so that predictions from the reference grid become rates
relative to the offset that had been specified in the model.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric value to use for subsequent predictions or
back-transformation bias adjustments. If not specified, we use
<code>sigma(object)</code>, if available, and <code>NULL</code> otherwise.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>counterfactuals, wt.counter, avg.counter</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>counterfactuals</code> specifies character
names of counterfactual factors. If this is non-missing, a reference grid
is created consisting of combinations of counterfactual levels and a constructed
factor <code>.obs.no.</code> having a level for each observation in the dataset.
By default, this grid is re-gridded with the response transformation
and averaged over <code>.obs.no.</code> (by default, with equal weights, but
a vector of weights may be specified in <code>wt.counter</code>; it must be
of length equal to the number of observations in the dataset).
If <code>avg.counter</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code>, this averaging is disabled.
See the section below on counterfactuals.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nuisance, non.nuisance, wt.nuis</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>nuisance</code> is a vector of predictor names,
those predictors are omitted from the reference grid. Instead, the result 
will be as if we had averaged over the levels of those factors, with either 
equal or proportional weights as specified in <code>wt.nuis</code> (see the 
<code>weights</code> argument in <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code>). The factors in 
<code>nuisance</code> must not interact with other factors, not even other
nuisance factors. Specifying nuisance factors can save considerable
storage and computation time, and help avoid exceeding the maximum
reference-grid size (<code>get_emm_option("rg.limit")</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rg.limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer limit on the number of reference-grid rows to allow
(checked before any multivariate responses are included).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To users, the <code>ref_grid</code> function itself is important because most of
its arguments are in effect arguments of <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code> and related
functions, in that those functions pass their <code>...</code> arguments to
<code>ref_grid</code>.
</p>
<p>The reference grid consists of combinations of independent variables over
which predictions are made. Estimated marginal means are defined as these
predictions, or marginal averages thereof. The grid is determined by first
reconstructing the data used in fitting the model (see
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/recover_data.html">recover_data</a></code>), or by using the <code>data.frame</code> provided in
<code>data</code>. The default reference grid is determined by the observed levels
of any factors, the ordered unique values of character-valued predictors, and
the results of <code>cov.reduce</code> for numeric predictors. These may be
overridden using <code>at</code>. See also the section below on
recovering/overriding model information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of the S4 class <code>"emmGrid"</code> (see
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmGrid-class.html">emmGrid-class</a></code>). These objects encapsulate everything needed
to do calculations and inferences for estimated marginal means, and contain
nothing that depends on the model-fitting procedure.
</p>


<h3>Using <code>cov.reduce</code> and <code>cov.keep</code></h3>

<p>The <code>cov.keep</code> argument was not available in <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> versions
1.4.1 and earlier. Any covariates named in this list are treated as if they
are factors: all the unique levels are kept in the reference grid. The user
may also specify an integer value, in which case any covariate having no more
than that number of unique values is implicitly included in <code>cov.keep</code>.
The default for <code>cov.keep</code> is set and retrieved via the 
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emm_options.html">emm_options</a></code> framework, and the system default is <code>"2"</code>,
meaning that covariates having only two unique values are automatically
treated as two-level factors. See also the Note below on backward compatibility.
</p>
<p>There is a subtle distinction between including a covariate in <code>cov.keep</code>
and specifying its values manually in <code>at</code>: Covariates included in 
<code>cov.keep</code> are treated as factors for purposes of weighting, while
specifying levels in <code>at</code> will not include the covariate in weighting.
See the <code>mtcars.lm</code> example below for an illustration.
</p>
<p><code>cov.reduce</code> may be a function,
logical value, formula, or a named list of these.
If a single function, it is applied to each covariate.
If logical and <code>TRUE</code>, <code>mean</code> is used. If logical and
<code>FALSE</code>, it is equivalent to including all covariates in
<code>cov.keep</code>. Use of <span class="samp">cov.reduce = FALSE</span> is inadvisable because it
can result in a huge reference grid; it is far better to use
<code>cov.keep</code>.
</p>
<p>If a formula (which must be two-sided), then a model is fitted to that
formula using <code><a href="../../stats/html/lm.html">lm</a></code>; then in the reference grid, its response
variable is set to the results of <code><a href="../../stats/html/predict.html">predict</a></code> for that model,
with the reference grid as <code>newdata</code>. (This is done <em>after</em> the
reference grid is determined.) A formula is appropriate here when you think
experimental conditions affect the covariate as well as the response.
</p>
<p>To allow for situations where a simple <code>lm()</code> call as described above won't
be adequate, a formula of the form <code>ext ~ fcnname</code> is also supported,
where the left-hand side may be <code>ext</code>, <code>extern</code>, or
<code>external</code> (and must <em>not</em> be a predictor name) and the
right-hand side is the name of an existing function. The function is called
with one argument, a data frame with columns for each variable in the
reference grid. The function is expected to use that frame as new data to
be used to obtain predictions for one or more models; and it should return
a named list or data frame with replacement values for one or more of the
covariates.
</p>
<p>If <code>cov.reduce</code> is a named list, then the above criteria are used to
determine what to do with covariates named in the list. (However, formula
elements do not need to be named, as those names are determined from the
formulas' left-hand sides.) Any unresolved covariates are reduced using
<code>"mean"</code>.
</p>
<p>Any <code>cov.reduce</code> of <code>cov.keep</code> specification for a covariate 
also named in <code>at</code> is ignored.
</p>


<h3>Interdependent covariates</h3>

<p>Care must be taken when covariate values
depend on one another. For example, when a polynomial model was fitted
using predictors <code>x</code>, <code>x2</code> (equal to <code>x^2</code>), and <code>x3</code>
(equal to <code>x^3</code>), the reference grid will by default set <code>x2</code> and
<code>x3</code> to their means, which is inconsistent. The user should instead
use the <code>at</code> argument to set these to the square and cube of
<code>mean(x)</code>. Better yet, fit the model using a formula involving
<code>poly(x, 3)</code> or <code>I(x^2)</code> and <code>I(x^3)</code>; then there is only
<code>x</code> appearing as a covariate; it will be set to its mean, and the
model matrix will have the correct corresponding quadratic and cubic terms.
</p>


<h3>Matrix covariates</h3>

<p>Support for covariates that appear in the dataset
as matrices is very limited. If the matrix has but one column, it is
treated like an ordinary covariate. Otherwise, with more than one column,
each column is reduced to a single reference value &ndash; the result of
applying <code>cov.reduce</code> to each column (averaged together if that
produces more than one value); you may not specify values in <code>at</code>; and
they are not treated as variables in the reference grid, except for
purposes of obtaining predictions.
</p>


<h3>Recovering or overriding model information</h3>

<p>Ability to support a
particular class of <code>object</code> depends on the existence of
<code>recover_data</code> and <code>emm_basis</code> methods &ndash; see
<a href="../../emmeans/help/extending-emmeans.html">extending-emmeans</a> for details. The call
<code>methods("recover_data")</code> will help identify these.
</p>
<p><b>Data.</b> In certain models, (e.g., results of
<code><a href="../../lme4/help/glmer.nb.html">glmer.nb</a></code>), it is not possible to identify the original
dataset. In such cases, we can work around this by setting <code>data</code>
equal to the dataset used in fitting the model, or a suitable subset. Only
the complete cases in <code>data</code> are used, so it may be necessary to
exclude some unused variables. Using <code>data</code> can also help save
computing, especially when the dataset is large. In any case, <code>data</code>
must represent all factor levels used in fitting the model. It
<em>cannot</em> be used as an alternative to <code>at</code>. (Note: If there is a
pattern of <code>NAs</code> that caused one or more factor levels to be excluded
when fitting the model, then <code>data</code> should also exclude those levels.)
</p>
<p><b>Covariance matrix.</b> By default, the variance-covariance matrix for
the fixed effects is obtained from <code>object</code>, usually via its
<code><a href="../../stats/html/vcov.html">vcov</a></code> method. However, the user may override this via a
<code>vcov.</code> argument, specifying a matrix or a function. If a matrix, it
must be square and of the same dimension and parameter order of the fixed
effects. If a function, must return a suitable matrix when it is called
with arguments <code>(object, ...)</code>. Be careful with possible 
unintended conflicts with arguments in <code>...</code>; for example, 
<code>sandwich::vcovHAC()</code> has optional arguments <code>adjust</code> and <code>weights</code>
that may be intended for <code>emmeans()</code> but will also be passed to <code>vcov.()</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Nested factors.</b> Having a nesting structure affects marginal
averaging in <code>emmeans</code> in that it is done separately for each level
(or combination thereof) of the grouping factors. <code>ref_grid</code> tries to
discern which factors are nested in other factors, but it is not always
obvious, and if it misses some, the user must specify this structure via
<code>nesting</code>; or later using <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code>. The
<code>nesting</code> argument may be a character vector, a named <code>list</code>, 
or <code>NULL</code>.
If a <code>list</code>, each name should be the name of a single factor in the
grid, and its entry a character vector of the name(s) of its grouping
factor(s). <code>nested</code> may also be a character value of the form
<code>"factor1 %in% (factor2*factor3)"</code> (the parentheses are optional).
If there is more than one such specification, they may be appended
separated by commas, or as separate elements of a character vector. For
example, these specifications are equivalent: <code>nesting = list(state =
  "country", city = c("state", "country")</code>, <code>nesting = "state %in%
  country, city %in% (state*country)"</code>, and <code>nesting = c("state %in%
  country", "city %in% state*country")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Predictors with subscripts and data-set references</h3>

<p>When the fitted
model contains subscripts or explicit references to data sets, the
reference grid may optionally be post-processed to simplify the variable
names, depending on the <code>simplify.names</code> option (see
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emm_options.html">emm_options</a></code>), which by default is <code>TRUE</code>. For example,
if the model formula is <code>data1$resp ~ data1$trt + data2[[3]] +
  data2[["cov"]]</code>, the simplified predictor names (for use, e.g., in the
<code>specs</code> for <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code>) will be <code>trt</code>,
<code>data2[[3]]</code>, and <code>cov</code>. Numerical subscripts are not simplified;
nor are variables having simplified names that coincide, such as if
<code>data2$trt</code> were also in the model.
</p>
<p>Please note that this simplification is performed <em>after</em> the
reference grid is constructed. Thus, non-simplified names must be used in
the <code>at</code> argument (e.g., <code>at = list(`data2["cov"]` = 2:4)</code>.
</p>
<p>If you don't want names simplified, use <code>emm_options(simplify.names =
  FALSE)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Prediction types and transformations</h3>

<p>Transformations can exist because of a link function in a generalized linear model, 
or as a response transformation, or even both. In many cases, they are auto-detected,
for example a model formula of the form <code>sqrt(y) ~ ...</code>. Even transformations
containing multiplicative or additive constants, such as <code>2*sqrt(y + pi) ~ ...</code>,
are auto-detected. A response transformation of <code>y + 1 ~ ...</code> is <em>not</em>
auto-detected, but <code>I(y + 1) ~ ...</code> is interpreted as <code>identity(y + 1) ~ ...</code>.
A warning is issued if it gets too complicated.
Complex transformations like the Box-Cox transformation are not auto-detected; but see 
the help page for <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/make.tran.html">make.tran</a></code> for information on some advanced methods.
</p>
<p>There is a subtle difference
between specifying <span class="samp">type = "response"</span> and <span class="samp">regrid =
  "response"</span>. While the summary statistics for the grid itself are the same,
subsequent use in <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code> will yield different results if
there is a response transformation or link function. With <span class="samp">type =
  "response"</span>, EMMs are computed by averaging together predictions on the
<em>linear-predictor</em> scale and then back-transforming to the response
scale; while with <span class="samp">regrid = "response"</span>, the predictions are
already on the response scale so that the EMMs will be the arithmetic means
of those response-scale predictions. To add further to the possibilities,
<em>geometric</em> means of the response-scale predictions are obtainable via
<span class="samp">regrid = "log", type = "response"</span>. See also the help page for 
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/regrid.html">regrid</a></code>.
</p>
<p><em>Order-of-processing issues:</em> 
The <code>regrid</code> argument, if present, is acted on immediately after the reference 
grid is constructed, while some of the <code>...</code> arguments may be used to
update the object at the very end. Thus, code like
<code>ref_grid(mod, tran = "sqrt", regrid = "response")</code> will not work correctly
if the intention was to specify the response transformation, because the re-grid 
is done <em>before</em> it processes <code>tran = "sqrt"</code>. To get the intended
result, do
<code>regrid(ref_grid(mod, tran = "sqrt"), transform = "response")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Counterfactuals</h3>

<p>If <code>counterfactuals</code> is specified, the rows of the entire dataset
become a factor in the reference grid, and the other reference levels are
confined to those named in <code>counterfactuals</code>. In this type of analysis
(called G-computation), we substitute each combination of counterfactual
levels into the entire dataset. Thus, predictions from this grid are those
of each observation under each of the counterfactual levels. For this to
make sense, we require an assumption of exchangeability of these levels.
</p>
<p>By default, this grid is converted to the response scale (unless otherwise
specified in <code>regrid</code> and averaged over the observations in the dataset.
Averaging can be disabled by setting <code>avg.counter = FALSE</code>, but
be warned that the resulting reference grid is potentially huge &ndash; the
number of observations in the dataset times the number of counterfactual 
combinations, times the number of multivariate levels.
</p>
<p>The counterfactuals code is still fairly rudimentary and we can't guarantee
it will always work, such as in cases of nested models. Sometimes, an error
can be averted by specifying <code>avg.counter = FALSE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Optional side effect</h3>

<p>If the <code>save.ref_grid</code> option is set to
<code>TRUE</code> (see <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emm_options.html">emm_options</a></code>),
The most recent result of <code>ref_grid</code>, whether
called directly or indirectly via <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code>,
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emtrends.html">emtrends</a></code>, or some other function that calls one of these, is
saved in the user's environment as <code>.Last.ref_grid</code>. This facilitates
checking what reference grid was used, or reusing the same reference grid
for further calculations. This automatic saving is disabled by default, but
may be enabled via <span class="samp">emm_options(save.ref_grid = TRUE)</span>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The system default for <code>cov.keep</code> causes models
containing indicator variables to be handled differently than in
<span class="pkg">emmeans</span> version 1.4.1 or earlier. To replicate older
analyses, change the default via 
<span class="samp">emm_options(cov.keep = character(0))</span>.
</p>
<p>Some earlier versions of <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> offer a <code>covnest</code> argument.
This is now obsolete; if <code>covnest</code> is specified, it is harmlessly
ignored. Cases where it was needed are now handled appropriately via the
code associated with <code>cov.keep</code>.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Reference grids are of class <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmGrid-class.html">emmGrid</a></code>,
and several methods exist for them &ndash; for example
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/summary.emmGrid.html">summary.emmGrid</a></code>. Reference grids are fundamental to
<code><a href="../../emmeans/help/emmeans.html">emmeans</a></code>. Supported models are detailed in
<a href="../doc/models.html"><code>vignette("models", "emmeans")</code></a>.
See <code><a href="../../emmeans/help/update.emmGrid.html">update.emmGrid</a></code> for details of arguments that can be in 
<code>options</code> (or in <code>...</code>).
