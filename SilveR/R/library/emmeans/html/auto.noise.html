<h2>Auto Pollution Filter Noise</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three-factor experiment comparing pollution-filter noise for two filters,
three sizes of cars, and two sides of the car.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
auto.noise
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 36 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>noise</code></dt><dd><p>Noise level in decibels - a numeric vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>size</code></dt><dd><p>The size of the vehicle - an ordered factor with
levels <code>S</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>L</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt><dd><p>Type of anti-pollution filter - a factor with levels
<code>Std</code> and <code>Octel</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>side</code></dt><dd><p>The side of the car where measurement was taken &ndash; a
factor with levels <code>L</code> and <code>R</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are from a statement by Texaco, Inc., to the Air and Water Pollution
Subcommittee of the Senate Public Works Committee on June 26, 1973.    
Mr. John McKinley, President of Texaco, cited an automobile filter developed
by Associated Octel Company as effective in reducing pollution. However, 
questions had been raised about the effects of filters on vehicle performance, 
fuel consumption, exhaust gas back pressure, and silencing. On the last 
question, he referred to the data included here as evidence that the silencing
properties of the Octel filter were at least equal to those of standard silencers.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The dataset was obtained from the Data and Story Library (DASL)
at Carnegie-Mellon University. Apparently it has since been removed. The
original dataset was altered by assigning meaningful names to the factors
and sorting the observations in random order as if this were the run order
of the experiment.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
noise.lm &lt;- lm(noise ~ size * type * side, data = auto.noise)

# Interaction plot of predictions
emmip(noise.lm, type ~ size | side)

# Confidence intervals
plot(emmeans(noise.lm, ~ size | side*type))
